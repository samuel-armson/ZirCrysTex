function ebsd_out = x_section_correction(ebsd_in,aquisition_method,varargin)
	%{
	Function to apply orientation 'corrections' to datasets which were collected in cross-section. This is neccessary to produce
	pole figures, ODF's, etc with the same reference frame as those obtained via conventional plan-view techniques. Essentially
	produces 'ND' pole figures. ND must be pointing 'up' after any scan rotation is applied.

	REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
	ebsd_in = ebsd dataset to be rotated. Provided by loadEBSD mTeX function.
	aquisition_method = 'SPED' or 'EBSD'. SPED collection has an associated inherent rotation about phi1, so it's easier to
						 explicitly state the collection method for this correction to be automatically performed.

	OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS / PARAMETERS (varargin)
	scan_rotation = eg. 90. Defualt value = 0. If this map was collected with an imperfect scan rotation, this can be corrected with this argument by
					performing a rotation (in degrees) around the sample's z-axis (as collected). This is particularly useful
					for SPED datasets, as samples are usually scanned at a 90 degree angle (although this can differ).
	SPED_inherent_rotation = eg. 18. Default value = 18. Only used for SPED. The FEI Technai TF30 at the University of Manchester,
								when operated at a magnification of 43k, has patterns rotated by 18 degrees in Ï†1.
